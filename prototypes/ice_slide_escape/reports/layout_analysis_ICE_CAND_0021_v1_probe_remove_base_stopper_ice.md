## LLM Reviewer Material

- Treat this report as evidence, not as a quality verdict.
- Read the key snapshots as candidate causal-chain nodes.
- Check whether each non-walk event produces a later consumed state change.
- Look for redundant space, forced weak edges, repeated same-operation padding, and bypass paths.
