## Counterfactuals

No counterfactual models are configured.

## Target Event Checks

### K_runtime_smoke

Reality Anchor v0 runtime smoke behavior is executable through the registered adapter.

- Required events: none
- Forbidden events: none
- Detector configured: false
- Returned solution covers detector: unknown
- Shortest bypass: not checked (No event detector is configured for this target.)
- Winning bypass: not checked (No event detector is configured for this target.)


## LLM Reviewer Material

- Treat this report as evidence, not as a quality verdict.
- Read the key snapshots as candidate causal-chain nodes.
- Check whether each non-walk event produces a later consumed state change.
- Look for redundant space, forced weak edges, repeated same-operation padding, and bypass paths.
